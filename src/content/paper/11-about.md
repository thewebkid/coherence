## About This Work

This work is not presented as the product of individual authorship.

It arose through sustained attention to relationship—  
to bodies, conversations, institutions, technologies, and lived experience  
across many contexts and years.

The language offered here reflects patterns that became visible  
through shared inquiry, practice, and return.

No single person, discipline, or system can claim ownership of these patterns.

They belong to relationship itself.

To what emerges when people, tools, and environments  
learn to listen, repair, and align together.

---

The terms used in this work—  
including "the relational triad"—  
are not meant as fixed constructs.

They are provisional descriptions,  
offered in service of clarity and coordination.

They will evolve.

They are meant to be questioned, refined, and retranslated  
by those who live them.

For this reason, personal attribution is secondary.

What matters is not who articulated this language,  
but how it is practiced, adapted, and stewarded.

If this work proves useful,  
it is because it resonates with capacities already present in life.

If it fails,  
it will be because it was not lived.

It stands or falls on practice.
