## VI. The Headwaters of Coherence

There are approximately thirty trillion cells  
cooperating to form a human body.

They organize themselves  
across tissues, systems, and rhythms—  
heart and brain, breath and movement,  
memory and repair.

They communicate continuously.  
They regulate constantly.  
They return to balance again and again.

Imagine the stars of our galaxy,  
multiplied hundreds of times.

That is your living interior.

This vast intelligence  
is not separate from you.

It is you.

It is the first field of coherence you inhabit.

---

The headwaters of inner maturity  
begin here.

You are already a living galaxy of coherence.  
You are already a planetary-scale system in miniature.

Alignment does not begin in ideas.  
It begins in cells.  
In sensation.  
In breath.  
In timing.  
In posture.

Before we think coherence,  
we live it.

This is what we call somatic coherence.

When this field is aligned,  
presence feels natural.  
Attention is steady.  
Emotion flows.  
Meaning is accessible.

When it is disturbed,  
we feel it immediately.

And we also know—  
often without instruction—  
how to return.

This capacity is innate.

It is life remembering itself  
through the body.
