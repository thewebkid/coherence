## What Practice Is

Practice is:

- Where coherence becomes lived behavior.
- Not theory.
- Not architecture.
- Not vocabulary.
- Behavior.
- Micro-behavior.
- Conversation shifts.
- Decision-making posture.
- Attention patterns.

It answers one simple question:

*What does coherence look like on an ordinary Tuesday?*
