### In Conversation

- Listen for alignment, not agreement.
- Ask: "What is the shared aim here?"
- Slow the rhythm when tension rises.

### In Decision-Making

- Separate reaction from response.
- Clarify long-term coherence over short-term gain.
- Ask: "Does this scale well across time?"

### In Systems & Work

- Design for clarity before speed.
- Prefer transparency over persuasion.
- Reduce unnecessary complexity.

### In Conflict

- Seek mutual orientation before resolution.
- Stabilize emotion before argument.
- Aim for coherence, not victory.

### In Solitude

- Notice where your thinking fragments.
- Recenter attention on what is stable.
- Return to your original intention.
