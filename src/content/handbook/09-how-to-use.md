## How to Use This Handbook

This handbook is not meant to be completed.  
It is meant to be returned to.

You do not need to practice everything at once.  
Begin where life is already asking something of you.

If direction feels unclear — begin with **Alignment**.  
If misalignment has occurred — practice **Return**.  
If working or creating with others — practice **Harmonized Sovereignty**.  
If relationships feel strained or distant — practice **Relational Coherence**.

Move slowly.  
Return often.

Coherence does not grow through intensity.  
It grows through continuity.

A few minutes of sincere practice  
will stabilize more than hours of effort performed without presence.

You may move through these practices in any order.  
You may return to the same one for years.  
There is no progression to complete.

Over time, the practices begin to support one another.  
Alignment deepens return.  
Return stabilizes relationships.  
Relationships become fields of shared becoming.

Let the handbook remain nearby.  
Open it when needed.  
Close it when life is clear.

That is sufficient.
