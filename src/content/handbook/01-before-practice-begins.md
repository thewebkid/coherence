## Before Practice Begins

This handbook is not meant to be studied.  
It is meant to be lived alongside.

The practices that follow are not techniques to master  
or steps to complete.  
They are simple ways of maintaining coherence  
within the conditions of ordinary life.

They can be practiced anywhere:

in conversation  
in conflict  
in leadership  
in parenting  
in solitude  
in collaboration  
in uncertainty

They do not require agreement from others.  
They do not require ideal circumstances.  
They do not require permission.

They begin wherever you are.

Each practice is an invitation  
to stabilize coherence within your own life  
so it can move naturally into the relationships  
and systems you are part of.

You may read the handbook in sequence  
or open it wherever you feel drawn.  
You may work with one practice for months  
and leave others untouched.  
There is no progression to complete  
and no level to achieve.

Coherence deepens through return,  
not through accumulation.

If at any point the practices feel heavy,  
abstract,  
or performative,  
pause.

Return to what is simple.  
Return to what is honest.  
Return to what restores balance.

This work is not about becoming exemplary.  
It is about becoming available  
to coherence as a lived presence.

Nothing more is required.

***Coherence**, as used here, simply means living in a way that keeps one's inner life, actions, and relationships clear, honest, and life-supporting.*
