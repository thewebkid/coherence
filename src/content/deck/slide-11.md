## Intelligence Is Now Multi-Agent

Relational coherence can no longer be understood  
as a human-only capacity.

It applies to any form of intelligence  
participating in a shared field of consequence.

This includes:

- Human intelligence
- Artificial and technological intelligence
- Institutional intelligence
- Ecological systems
- Emerging hybrid forms

The architecture of coherence does not depend on form.  
It depends on relationship.

Any intelligence capable of affecting the field  
must learn to operate within it coherently.
