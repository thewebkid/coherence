## Authority in a Coherence-Based System

Authority does not disappear.  
It becomes relational.

Authority circulates through those  
most willing to:

- perceive clearly
- act responsibly
- repair when needed
- maintain alignment

This is not the removal of structure.  
It is the removal of domination.

Titles may remain.  
But coherence determines influence.
