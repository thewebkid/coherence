## When Coherence Is Practiced Locally

Inside teams and organizations,  
this begins to change:

- Meetings become spaces of shared attention, not performance
- Mistakes become material for return, not blame
- Authority circulates through responsibility, not title
- Decisions consider long-term relational impact, not only speed
- Innovation increases because trust increases
- People act without waiting for permission when coherence is clear

This does not require permission from the whole system.  
It begins wherever one node practices it consistently.
