## What Makes Coherence Possible Now?

Relational coherence can no longer rely on:  
shared location,  
shared culture,  
or shared identity.

It must be consciously practiced  
across difference, distance, and scale.

New forms of relational coherence require:

- Awareness of the full relational field ("we")
- The capacity to align locally
- The ability to repair and return
- The willingness to evolve together

These capacities allow coherence to emerge  
without control or uniformity.

They can be practiced by individuals, teams, and institutions alike.
