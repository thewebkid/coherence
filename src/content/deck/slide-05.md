## A New Relational Condition

Human systems are entering a new phase of development.

For the first time:

Intelligence is no longer single-species.  
Decision-making is increasingly distributed across  
humans, technologies, and automated systems.  
Actions at one scale propagate instantly across others.

This is not only technological change.  
It is a change in the structure of relationship itself.

The question is no longer how we optimize systems.  
The question is whether we can remain coherent across scales  
as the field of participants expands.
