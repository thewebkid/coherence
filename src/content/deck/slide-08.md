## Coherence Across Scales

Coherence across scales is the capacity of a system  
to remain aligned from cell to civilization.

When coherence holds at one scale,  
it strengthens others.

When it collapses at one scale,  
it propagates.

In a multi-agent world,  
coherence must be carried locally  
and perceived relationally.

This is no longer optional.  
It is developmental.
