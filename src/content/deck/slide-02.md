## The Relational Triad (Engine)

Shared Becoming → we evolve together  
Relational Coherence → we stay aligned  
Harmonized Sovereignty → we act without domination or withdrawal

"We" = all participants within a relational field of consequence.

Coherence Across Scales = the capacity to act locally while perceiving the full relational field.

**Said another way…**

Coherence Across Scales (phenomenon)  
  ↓  
Depends on accurate perception of "we"  
  ↓  
Which activates the relational triad (engine)  
  ↓  
Which is stabilized through alignment + return

So defining "we" is the ignition point.

**In short:**

Act locally.  
Perceive relationally.  
Repair visibly.  
Align to the relational triad continuously.

This is developmental maturity.
