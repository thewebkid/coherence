## The Resulting Tension

As intelligence and action distribute across scales:

Technology accelerates faster than relational maturity.  
Institutions struggle to maintain trust.  
Individuals feel increasing fragmentation.  
Consequences travel further than awareness.

Most systems were designed for a simpler "we."  
They are now operating within a far more complex one.

Without new forms of relational coherence,  
fragmentation compounds.

With them,  
alignment becomes possible across scales.
