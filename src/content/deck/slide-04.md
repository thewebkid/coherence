## Some Key Definitions…

### Alignment —

The ongoing practice of aligning thought, action, and relationship  
with the relational triad:

- Shared Becoming — we evolve together
- Relational Coherence — we stay aligned
- Harmonized Sovereignty — we act without domination or withdrawal

As understanding deepens, alignment becomes more precise.  
It is practiced locally, continuously, and across scales.

### Return —

The practice of restoring alignment with the relational triad  
when misalignment occurs.

Return involves recognizing impact,  
taking responsibility,  
and re-entering relationship with clarity.

Return keeps coherence alive.  
Without it, fragmentation accumulates.
